# Misc
What are some simple but nontrivial and intuitive examples of vector spaces


Want a visualization of how the parameter for weight decay (lambda) shrinks the weights towards zero. relationship between this and l2 regularization and the visualization of how and why l1 gives sparse solutions while l2 does not (or do I have that backwards? See, it's because I don't have good intuition)

[ ] Add LLM call to update/convert any given 3blue1brown piece of manim code to work with the open source version of manim instead of the private one?
-> otherwise will be helping it generate the wrong code!

For using manimgl (3b1b's private manim) rather than the open source version of manim:
pip install manimgl
pip install setuptools
add manim_imports_ext.py to root
Add custom folder with the required files
