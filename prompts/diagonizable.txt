Think of a matrix as representing a linear map and consider what equations like D = BAB-1
have to do with change-of-basis; i.e. with representing the same linear transformation
with respect to different bases.

Show how diagonalizable matrices represent transformations that are just stretching/shrinking 
of some basis. Triangularizable matrices represent transformations for which there is a 
sequence of subspaces of dimensions 1, 2, ..., n, such that the underlying transformation maps each subspace to itself.

A linear transformation T: Rn -> Rn takes n-dimensional shapes and stretches, rotates, shears, 
and reflects them in various ways to create new n-dimensional shapes.

In particular, take an n-dimensional parallelepiped, let's call it A, formed from edges 
starting from the origin (these are the vectors that characterize the parallelepiped). 
Then T(A) is a new n-dimensional parallelepiped. If T has a null space, then T(A) will be
flat along dim(nul(T)) of its edges.

T is diagonalizable over R if there's some n-dimensional parallelepiped B such that 
T(B) merely scales the edges of B. The scale factors for each edge are the eigenvalues.

diagonalizable matrices basically mean your transformation can be thought of as 
‘just scaling’ when viewed in an appropriate basis.
