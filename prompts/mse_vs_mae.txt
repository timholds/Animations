write python code using the 3blue1brown open source manim library. it should visualize a typical MSE problem in two dimensions, like the price of housing against the square footage. The code should start with the L1 norm and evolve to visualize the L2 and L infinity norms, illustrating the intuition for why the l infinity norm converges to the largest element and why the L2 norm is perpendicular
