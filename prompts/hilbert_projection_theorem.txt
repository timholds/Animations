Write a manim python script to illustrate the core intuition behind the hilbert projection theorem. you should carefully select the numerical values used in the video so they the maximally illustrate the concept and the concept only
it would be great if we could do this from the main method of the file so that i dont need to add any arguments when running it. ideally there would be a few arguments for the quality and render resolution
lets make a small adjustment so that it shows the preview by default and we can pass an arg no_preview to prevent the preview from showing
excellent start, this works to create a video wonderfully! now, lets update our animation to help make the intuition even clearer. as a reminder, what is the golden nugget of visual intuition the phrase hilbert projection invokes? it might help to recall that we will end up using this as part of a machine learning math videos series, though it does not need to be explicitly connected to neural networks in the video
